		<h3>Build A Responsive Website With HTML & CSS Tutorial</h3>
		&emsp;Watching the YouTube video “Build A Responsive Website With HTML & CSS Tutorial” by Dev Ed was a very interesting experience to watch someone else code and how they do it. The first 10 or so minutes of the video I would say was pretty basic with html but then he started getting into display flex, which I have been using at work for the past couple of months. Watching how he uses display flex was very different then how I use it, so I was very excited about learning more about it. Ed used a main tag and not a div. I have been taught to use divs so seeing the main tag was very cool and I’ll implement it into my website. <br/>

		&emsp;The next interesting thing I found in the video was a lot of different small css tricks. I’ve also never heard of a webkit so learning how to use that for images to make them transparent, etc is very useful. I also never knew you could remove the dot from the li tag using list-style: none. I always go into photoshop to edit my images so using filter to edit images on the webpage to add a drop shadow, contrast, or blur will become very useful. The last css trick I learned throughout the video was keyframes and how to do transitions. I never realized how easy they were to implement and how nice they make the page look.

		<h3>Smashingmagazine Common Usability Blunders</h3>
		<li>1.	Tiny Clickable Areas</li>
		<p>Trying to click on a very small location with your mouse is one of the most annoying things on the internet. Even worse than that trying is trying to use your thumb on a mobile device to try to click on tiny clickable areas they are definitely a no go.</p>
		<li>2.	Too Much Functionality That Requires Registration</li>
		<p>This has been happening to me a lot lately because of the chrome ad on AdBlock. Ad block hides ads from loading on page load and companies have started to add JavaScript to their website that forces you to either get rid of ad block or sign up for their services. This has caused me to leave a lot of websites and find the information somewhere else.</p>
		<li>3.	Old Permalinks Pointing Nowhere </li>
		<p>Keeping the entire website up to date is the most important part of a website. Having updates that break parts of the website that some people might use every day can be very frustrating to the user. Before updating a website make sure to test and make sure that the entire website works as needed.</p>
		<h3>Smashingmagazine Usability Issues To Be Aware Of</h3>
		<li>1.	3-Click-Rule </li>
		<p>I have never heard of the 3-click-rule, but it makes sense. I Definity do this when I’m trying to find information, I want fast. If I can’t find it within a couple of seconds I go to a different page.</p>
		<li>2.	Usability Nightmares</li>
		<p>We have all been to the websites that you don’t understand how to navigate at all and no one takes the time to figure out how to. Usually everyone will be off of that page in seconds.</p>
		<li>3.	Baby-Duck-Syndrome</li>
		<p>I feel like I’m in that funk currently and all of the websites I create are all very much alike and I use the first website I created as a base. I need to move on from that and start to try new and bigger ideas.</p>
		<li>4.	Banner-Blindness</li>
		<p>Banner-Blindness is when there is so much going on in a page that you only look at the text instead of the styles of the website. Large annoying banners will be ignored by the eyes because we have seen them so much and we have learned to ignore them.</p>
		<li>5.	The law of similarity</li>
		<p>It is very important to keep all of your information that is similar together you don’t want the user searching and searching for information or they might never come back.</p>
		<li>6.	The law of symmetry</li>
		<p>A web law that needs more attention as nonsymmetric on the eyes can cause some people to go insane. Everyone wants a nice symmetric website that is easy and fluid to navigate.</p>
		<li>7.	Legibility</li>
		<p>We have all been to that website that hurts your eyes and you can barely read anything. That is why a nice light background on dark text is the best route to go. </p>
		<li>8.	The Law Of Prägnanz</li>
		<p>A very interesting law that shows that you should put the most important objects on the page in a visual field and have the less important objects in the background of the website.</p>
		<li>9.	Fold</li>
		<p>A fold on a website is the area of the website that is no longer visible on the screen. This is area that you have to scroll to get to. This is the less important information as you need to capture the audience in the screenful part of the website.</p>
		<li>10.	Hotspot</li>
		<p>The area of the website that is clickable and it changes it’s appearance when hovered. This shows the user that the link is clickable and will take you to a different part of the website.</p>
		<h3>Crazyegg Principles Website Usability</h3>
		<li>1. Availability and Accessibility</li>
		<p>You want to make sure that your website is up at all times in order for the customer to be able to remember your website and want to access it again. You don’t want to go to a website and get a 404-error page. You also don’t want to go to a website that has a bunch of broken links that like you to an error page. Another way your website could be not accessible is if it isn’t mobile friendly and you have to go to a desktop view in order to access the website.</p>
		<li>2.	Clarity</li>
		<p>In a website you want a very clear and usable design. The website should be simple but also have a lot of information for the customer to be able to get the information they need. The website should be like websites you access every day, so everyone knows how to use and go through the site. You also want to be very consistent, so it doesn’t seem like a different page is a completely different website.</p>
		<li>3.	Learnability</li>
		<p>You want the customer to be able to access your website and learn how to use it within a fast period of time. You don’t want to release updates that consistently change the website layout that confuses a customer. A popular website YouTube does this and everyone always hates that changes when they occur.</p>
		<li>4.	Credibility</li>
		<p>You want your website to be credible with sources and no mistakes that make it seem like a 12-year-old created the website and made up information.</p>
		<li>5.	Relevancy</li>
		<p>You want people to access and read your website, so it has to have some relevance to people. There’s no reason for them to access your website if it’s just a bunch of useless information that only retains to yourself. </p>
