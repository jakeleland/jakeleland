		<h3>The Mitt Romney Web Font Problem</h3>
		&emsp;The problem is that the FOIT created a race condition that altered the integrity of the content. The word “not” did not appear until the whole page loaded and by that time some people might have read the title as Mitt Romney Is Officially Running for President, but he isn’t running for president. If this news organization is creditable then this can start the spread of fake news around the world and we don’t need more of that in the United States. This could lead to fights, different opinions or even war. <br/>

		&emsp;As a web developer there are ways to fix this such as the font loading solution documented on https://dev.opera.com/articles/better-font-face/. If you don’t want to completely eliminate FOIT you can group the fonts into a single repaint. Web browsers should also change to help fix the problem. They should block font-rendering behavior in a smarter way.<br/><br/>
