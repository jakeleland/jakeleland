		<h3>ECMAScript</h3>
		For the second article I’m going to be talking about ECMAScript which is the specifications for JavaScript. According to techopedia “ECMAScript is a scripting language based on JavaScript. ECMAScript is widely used on the World Wide Web especially for client-side scripting.” [1] ECMAScript is used to standardize JavaScript as a web language. Wikipedia also has a lot of information on ECMAScript including that “ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js.” [2] <br/>
		The first edition of ECMAScript was published in 1997 and since then there have been a total of 10 different updates. There are a bunch of different features that get updated such as in 2015 the keywords let and const where introduced. The reason they were introduced into ECMAScript was because of function scoping. Also, in 2015 automatic semicolon insertion was supported. This adds a semicolon where the web knows it needs one instead of to having to constantly put semi colons after every line of code. ECMAScript is very important to the world wide web because without it we wouldn’t have standardizations for JavaScript and the language would be all over the place. <br/><br/>
